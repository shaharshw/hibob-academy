/**
 * Exercise Instructions:
 *
 * Write tests for addPerson method:
 *
 * Test adding a unique person.
 * Test adding a duplicate person and ensure it throws the expected exception.
 * Test adding multiple people, checking that the list grows appropriately.
 *
 *
 * Write tests for removePerson method:
 *
 * Test removing a person that exists in the list.
 * Test trying to remove a person that does not exist, ensuring it returns false.
 * Test the state of the list after multiple add and remove operations.
 *
 *
 * Write tests for getPeopleSortedByAgeAndName method:
 *
 * Test with an empty list.
 * Test with one person.
 * Test with multiple people to ensure they are sorted first by age, then by name.
 * Test with edge cases like people with the same name but different ages and vice versa.
 *
